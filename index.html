    <h2>What Makes Zen Garden Interesting
    </h2>
    <p> My first impression of the Zen Garden is about its neat organization, which makes me feel really comfortable in browsing
      the website. The comfort comes from the success of many areas: the layout, the collocation of the color (green can make
      people even more comfortable), the background, and the font. The designer not only works on the overall outlook, but also
      pays a lot of attention to those minature details. For instance, at the very first when the audience try to look at the links
      to download both HTML and CSS files, there would be a darker green hover. It is of course not hard to design a hover, but the
      color matches really well. Those details make the whole website better. And the Zen Garden provides many good designs we can 
      use for reference. They are all really neat in terms of the the design of the page.

    <h3>My Favorite CSS Design off of the Website</h3>
    <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/"> The Address</a>
    <p> My favorite part is the design as a whole, because every elements there is coherent with each other. If I have to pick
      one among those, I would say the whole layout is really cool. The book has mentioned about it. Either the liquid layout or
      using the grid can help achieve such effect. The liquid one is better because the size of each element is in percentage to the
      size of the screen that the size can adjust itself in different electronic euqipment. In addition, the box is used a lot in 
      the design too. <p>

    <h3>CSS Not in the Book</h3>

    <li>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_icons.asp"> The Icon</a>
    </li>
    <p> The icon in the titile of the page is really cool.</p>
    <li>
       <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp"> Change of the Text When You Hover Over</a>
    </li>
    <p> When you hover over the navigation, the color and the type style of the text would change. The book has mentioned some, 
    but not all. The W3school provides many ways to change the text.</p>
